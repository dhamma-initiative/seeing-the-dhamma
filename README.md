# Welcome to The Dhamma-Initiative's - Seeing the Dhamma

This site is an attempt to extract the Buddha's instructions on causality for the purpose of quick reference and comprehension of Dhamma.

In [The Great Elephant Footprint Simile MN28][1] the Buddha says:
> * Whoever sees dependent co-arising sees the Dhamma;
> 
> * Whoever sees the Dhamma sees dependent co-arising.


But what exactly is dependent co-arising?


## Dependent co-arising

The Buddha's awakening is briefly outlined in the [Awakening (1) Ud 1:1][2] sutta:
> On that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. 
>
> Then, with the passing of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, in the first watch of the night, he gave close attention to **dependent co-arising** in forward order, thus:
>
> * When this is, that is.
> 
> * From the arising of this comes the arising of that 
>
> ....
>
> Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
> 
>> As phenomena grow clear
>>
>> to the brahman–ardent, in jhāna–
>>
>> his doubts all vanish
>>
>> when he discerns
>>
>> **a phenomenon with its cause**.


Therefore, on this site the attention will be on:
  1. phenomenon, and it's
  2. cause or requisite condition


## Organistion

This site has been organised based on the Sutta Pitaka's collections. This site intentionally mirrors https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/ which has been used as the **_exclusive_** source material. Each suttas may document one or more causation models where applicable.

|Collection|Description|
|:--|:--|
|[Anguttara Nikaya](./AN/README.md)|The Numerical Collection|

Table: Sutta Pitaka Collections

Use the links in the Sutta Pitaka collections table above to access the collection pages and from there navigate to individual suttas.

Note, throughout this site I have deliberately replaced all accented characters in Pali references to make them more conveniently searchable using a standard keyboard for entry.

May you discover the **cause** of happiness and act on it.
