> These three types of people, like the three types of sick people, are to be found existing in the world. Which three?
> 1. There is the case of the person who—
>     * regardless of whether he does or doesn’t get to see the Tathagata, 
>     * regardless of whether he does or doesn’t get to hear the Dhamma & Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathagata—
>       * will not alight on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful qualities
>
> 2. There is the case of the person who—
>     * regardless of whether he does or doesn’t get to see the Tathagata, 
>     * regardless of whether he does or doesn’t get to hear the Dhamma & Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathagata—
>       * will alight on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful qualities
>
> 3. There is the case of the person who 
>     * will alight on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful qualities 
>       * if he gets to see the Tathagata and gets to hear the Dhamma & Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathagata, 
>       * but not if he doesn’t 
>
> It is because there is this sort of person that the other sorts of persons are to be taught the Dhamma as well [on the chance that they may actually turn out to need and benefit from the teaching]
