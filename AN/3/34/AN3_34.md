> * Any action performed with greed—born of greed, caused by greed, originating from greed: 
>   * Wherever one’s selfhood [atta-bhava] turns up, there that action will ripen. 
>   * Where that action ripens, there one will experience its fruit, either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence.
>
> * Any action performed with aversion—born of aversion, caused by aversion, originating from aversion: 
>   * Wherever one’s selfhood turns up, there that action will ripen. 
>   * Where that action ripens, there one will experience its fruit, either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence.
>
> * Any action performed with delusion—born of delusion, caused by delusion, originating from delusion: 
>   * Wherever one’s selfhood turns up, there that action will ripen. 
>   * Where that action ripens, there one will experience its fruit, either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence
