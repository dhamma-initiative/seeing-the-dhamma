### Quote(s):
> *  If one is venerable—80, 90, 100 years old—
>     * yet if one partakes of sensuality, 
>     * lives in the midst of sensuality, 
>     * burns with sensual fever, 
>     * is chewed up by sensual thoughts, and 
>     * is eager in the search for sensuality, 
>>    * then one is reckoned simply as a young fool, not an elder
> * If one is a youngster, youthful—a black-haired young person endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life—
>     * yet does not partake of sensuality, 
>     * does not live in the midst of sensuality, 
>     * does not burn with sensual fever, 
>     * is not chewed up by sensual thoughts, and 
>     * is not eager in the search for sensuality, 
>>    * then one is reckoned as a wise elder
>>      * thus worthy of respect
