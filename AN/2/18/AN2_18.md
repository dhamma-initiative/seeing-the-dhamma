### Quote(s):
> * Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, & mental misconduct should not be done
>   * These are the drawbacks one can expect when doing what should not be done: 
>     1. One can fault oneself; 
>     2. observant people, on close examination, criticize one; 
>     3. one’s bad reputation gets spread about; 
>     4. one dies confused; and—on the break-up of the body, after death—one reappears in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell
